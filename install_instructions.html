<h1>Welcome to WPBook</h1>

<p>WPBook is a plugin for integrating WordPress and Facebook. It provides robust functionality, including:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Support for a view of your WordPress blog as a Facebook application, including full pages and posts, with embedded media. This 
         view is highly customizable, with custom headers/footers for each post, share links, and links to each post on the external 
         WordPress blog.</li>
    <li>Support for comments posted by users within that Facebook application view; these are treated as native WordPress comments.</li>
    <li>Tabs for Facebook profiles (individual) and Pages. Tab view can include full posts but strips out tags
        that Facebook does not allow (embedded videos, iframes).</li>
    <li>Support for posting excerpts to Facebook wall (on individual profile and/or Page) with urls pointing to either the external 
        blog permalink or to the Facebook application view.</li>
    <li>Support for importing to WordPress comments made against excerpts posted on Facebook walls.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>As a result, it is admittedly quite complex to setup.</p>

<p>These instructions break the tasks up in to the following steps:</p>

<p><ol>
    <li><a href="install_step1.html">Basic Facebook Application Setup and Plugin Activation</a></li>
    <li><a href="install_step2.html">Add to Profile / Tabs</a></li>
    <li><a href="install_step3.html">Publishing Excerpts to Facebook Wall(s)</a></li>
    <li><a href="install_step4.html">Import Comments from Facebook Wall(s)</a></li>
</ol></p>

<p>These instructions also contain reference screenshots for major settings; if you're still unable to configure WPBook, please post in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/wpbook?forum_id=10">support forum</a>. 
   Be sure to provide links to your Facebook application, your WordPress blog url, and specific information about where you're
   having trouble.</p>
