Plugin to embed Wordpress Blog into Facebook Platform.

== Overview ==

WPBook enables users to add your (self-hosted, not wordpress.com) wordpress 
blog as a Facebook application. Facebook users will see your posts in a 
Facebook look and feel, and can leave comments with their Facebook identity. 

Comments are shared - meaning comments made by users on your blog at its 
regular domain and comments made by users inside Facebook are all shown to 
users of either "view" of your content. 

Facebook users can also - at their option - add a profile box to their profile,
using the "add to profile" button at the top of the default canvas page. 

That profile box shows the 5 most recent posts from your blog, as links. 

== Installation ==
1. Copy the entire wpbook directory into your wordpress plugins folder,
   /wp-content/plugins/

   You should have a directory structure like this:
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/wpbook.php
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/theme/
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/client/
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/php4client/

   NOTE: If you've used previous versions, you no longer need to copy
   the wp-facebook folder (which no longer exists) to your themes directory. 
   
   If you've used versions prior to 0.9.5, you can DELETE the following 
   directory and all it's contents: 
		/wp-content/themes/wp-facebook/ 

2. Set up a New Application at http://www.facebook.com/developers/, obtaining
   a secret and API key.  

   Set the callback url to your blog url, including  a trailing slash. 
       (http://www.yourblogurl.com/)
   For canvas url, you just need something unique, with no spaces, and 
   no trailing slash. Remember it. 
   
   Set the application type to "website"
      
   Set the application to use an iFrame, not fbml, and to "resizable"
   (Using iFrames lets you use javascript, objects, and other tags 
    not allowed in FBML inside blog posts)

3. Login to Wordpress Admin and activate the plugin

4. Using the WPBook menu, (located under the options tag, "WPBook") fill 
   in the appropriate information including Facebook application secret 
   and API keys, as well as your application canvas url. 

   Enabling the "Show Invite Friends Link" will show a link inside 
   Facebook when viewing your application which allows users to send
   invites to their friends. 

5. If you wish to enable users to add your blog application to Facebook
   Pages, not just individual user profiles, get the default FBML by 
   visiting the settings page inside Wordpress, and enter that in the 
   appropriate place (default FBML) within the Facebook Application Settings
   page, using the Facebook Developer Application. 

   Note that this currently has to be entered in two places: in the
   "User Profiles" tab AND in the "Pages" tab. Not sure why. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit the way my Facebook Application (mirrored blog) looks? =

In the wpbook/theme directory, there is an index.php file.  Most of 
what you want is there.  

There's also a default/style.css which basically mimics Facebook's styles, as well 
as some other files for processing comments and the like.
