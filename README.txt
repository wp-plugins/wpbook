Plugin to embed Wordpress Blog into Facebook Platform.

== Installation ==
1. Copy wpbook.php into your wordpress plugins folder, normally located
   in /wp-content/plugins/

2. Copy the wp-facebook directory into your themes folder, normally
   located in /wp-content/themes/

   Note that if you use the "automated update" of plugins feature, you will 
   need to copy the theme to the appropriate location each time an update 
   is issued.  

3. Set up a New Application at http://www.facebook.com/developers/, obtaining
   a secret and API key.  

   Set the callback url to your blog url, including  a trailing slash. 
       (http://www.yourblogurl.com/)
   For canvas url, you just need something unique, with no spaces, and 
   no trailing slash. Remember it. 
   
   Set the application type to "website"
   
   Set the sidenav url to your canvas url
   
   Set the application to use an iFrame, not fbml, and to "resizable"
   (Using iFrames lets you use javascript, objects, and other tags 
    not allowed in FBML inside blog posts)

4. Login to Wordpress Admin and activate the plugin

5. Using the WPBook menu, (located under the options tag, "WPBook") fill 
   in the appropriate information including Facebook application secret 
   and API keys, as well as your application canvas url. 

   Enabling the "Show Invite Friends Link" will show a link inside 
   Facebook when viewing your application which allows users to send
   invites to their friends. 

Additional notes for "Add to Profile" Box:

WPBook enables Facebook users, once they "allow" the application access,
to add a profile box to their profile, using the "add to profile" button
at the top of the default canvas page. 

That profile box shows the 5 most recent posts from your blog, as links. 

However, in order to update the contents of the profile box, WPBook
needs an "inifinite session" key - basically needs your permission to
make some calls to facebook to refresh the recent posts even while 
you are not logged in. 

In the WPBook configuration page inside WordPress, there are some 
directions which try to make clear what you need to do to get your
infinite session key - please let us know if they are not clear. 

NOTE: If you update using the "automatic update" feature, you will
      need to copy the theme files (in the wp-facebook subdirectory) 
      over to wp-content/themes/ for the plugin updates to work. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit the way my Facebook Application (mirrored blog) looks? =

In the wp-facebook theme directory, there is an index.php file.  Most of 
what you want is there.  

There's also a style.css which basically mimics Facebook's styles, as well 
as some other files for processing comments and the like.

* First attempt at profile boxes. Works, but process is a bit hectic.

   Could open FB page in a jQuery popup, perhaps?
   When the user hits inifinitesession.php, couldn't I just set the option
   right then?
* Do we need an option to not show the "add to profile" box?
* Do I also need to direct user to set default fbml for the "pages" box,
  or is that handled automagically?
