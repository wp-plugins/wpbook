Plugin to embed Wordpress Blog into Facebook Platform.

== Overview ==

WPBook enables users to add your (self-hosted, not wordpress.com) wordpress 
blog as a Facebook application. Facebook users will see your posts in a 
Facebook look and feel, and can leave comments with their Facebook identity. 

Comments are shared - meaning comments made by users on your blog at its 
regular domain and comments made by users inside Facebook are all shown to 
users of either "view" of your content. 

Facebook users can also - at their option - add a profile box to their profile,
using the "add to profile" button at the top of the default canvas page. 

That profile box shows the 5 most recent posts from your blog, as links. 

NOTE: These 2 plugins have been reported to conflict with WPBook:
	- Bad Behavior 
	- Facebook Connect (from Sociable.es)

I'm working on identifying and eliminating conflict, but you should not
try to use WPBook with either of these plugins in the current state. 

Finally, if one of your other plugins (Kaltura's Interactive Video for
example) uses CSS and sets the height of either the body or html elements
to 100%, the auto-resizing javascript in Facebook will fail. You can 
fix this by removing the plugin or editing the css. 

== Installation ==

1. Copy the entire wpbook directory into your wordpress plugins folder,
   /wp-content/plugins/

   You should have a directory structure like this:
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/wpbook.php
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/theme/
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/client/
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/php4client/

   NOTE: If you've used previous versions, you no longer need to copy
   the wp-facebook folder (which no longer exists) to your themes directory. 
   
   If you've used versions prior to 0.9.5, you can DELETE the following 
   directory and all it's contents: 
		/wp-content/themes/wp-facebook/ 

2. Set up a New Application at http://www.facebook.com/developers/, obtaining
   a secret and API key.  

   Set the callback url to your blog url, including  a trailing slash. 
       (http://www.yourblogurl.com/)
   For canvas url, you just need something *all lower case*, unique, with
   no spaces, and no trailing slash. Remember it. 
   
   Set the application type to "website"
      
   Set the application to use an iFrame, not fbml, and to "resizable"
   (Using iFrames lets you use javascript, objects, and other tags 
    not allowed in FBML inside blog posts)

3. Login to Wordpress Admin and activate the plugin

4. Using the WPBook menu, (Dashboard->Settings->WPBook) fill 
   in the appropriate information including Facebook application secret 
   and API keys, as well as your application canvas url. 

   Enabling the "Show Invite Friends Link" will show a link inside 
   Facebook when viewing your application which allows users to send
   invites to their friends. 

   Comments inside Facebook can be enabled or disabled without any impact
   on comments when your blog is viewed outside Facebook. If you have comments
   enabled, you can optionally require users to provide their email address. 
   (Facebook does not allow access to the user's email address, so you can 
   really only ask users to provide one, not prefill it automatically). 

   The "Give WPBook credit" option adds a line at the bottom of your Facebook
   application pages which says "This Facebook application powered by the 
   WPBook plugin for Wordpress" - I'd love it if you would leave this enabled
   but it is not required.  

   The "Share this post" links can also be enabled or disabled. If they are
   enabled, they will allow the user to "share" your blog posts using the 
   built in Facebook Share mechanism, including sending a message to friends
   or posting in their profile. 

   The "Enable 'view post at external site' link" enables a link to each blog post 
   at your full blog url (outside Facebook). This is useful to get folks going
   to your blog outside Facebook, to see it full size/theme etc. 

   The "Link position for share button and external link button" option determines
   where, within each post, those two links will appear - either at the top of the 
   post (before the post content) or at the bottom of the post (after the post
   content). 

   "Enable Facebook users to add your app to their profile" will show an "Add to 
   Profile" button for users viewing the app inside Facebook - this lets them choose
   to add the application to their profile. 

5. To add the application to "Pages" not just "Profiles" - see the instructions linked to from the "settings" page for the plugin. 
     
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit the way my Facebook Application (mirrored blog) looks? =

In the wpbook/theme directory, there is an index.php file.  Most of 
what you want is there.  

There's also a default/style.css which basically mimics Facebook's styles, 
as well as some other files for processing comments and the like.

== To Do ==
* Capture Facebook Profile picture of user commenting in
  Facebook, display instead of Gravatar. (I think this 
  will require actually fetching and storing the picture,
  not just its url, as it may not be available outside
  Facebook, and may change). 
* Deal with non-standard front pages (where user has set
  a static page in WordPress options)
* Add notification to wall/notes when user publishes
  a new post - for all users, for author? 

= Ongoing =
* Better accompanying documentation
  (Screenshots of examples, clarity on what's required
   where, all the facebook option pages, etc)
