Plugin to embed Wordpress Blog into Facebook Platform.

== Overview ==

WPBook enables users to add your (self-hosted, not wordpress.com) wordpress 
blog as a Facebook application. Facebook users will see your posts in a 
Facebook look and feel, and can leave comments with their Facebook identity. 

Comments are shared - meaning comments made by users on your blog at its 
regular domain and comments made by users inside Facebook are all shown to 
users of either "view" of your content. 

Facebook users can also - at their option - add a profile box to their profile,
using the "add to profile" button at the top of the default canvas page. 

That profile box shows the 5 most recent posts from your blog, as links. 

WPBook *DOES NOT* (in it's current versions) do any of these:
  - Post notifications automatically to your wall when you write a new post
  - Post notifications into your users feeds when you publish a post
  - Post notifications to a group or fan page when you publish a new post
  - Post notifications back to a users feed when he/she posts a comment

If you'd like to do these things, please investigate:
 - Simplaris Blogcast (http://apps.facebook.com/flogblog/)
 - The Facebook Notes application (for fan pages) 
     (http://www.facebook.com/notes.php) 
 - The Sociable Facebook Connect plugin
     (http://www.sociable.es/facebook-connect/)

Posting updates into the notifications stream is a frequently requested
feature and will likely make it into a future version, but it will take
time. 

If one of your other plugins (Kaltura's Interactive Video for
example) uses CSS and sets the height of either the body or html elements
to 100%, the auto-resizing javascript in Facebook may fail. You can 
fix this by removing the plugin or editing the css. 

== Installation ==

(Note: installation instructions are also included in HTML and as a PDF
 along with the plugin)

1. Copy the entire wpbook directory into your wordpress plugins folder,
   /wp-content/plugins/

   You should have a directory structure like this:
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/wpbook.php
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/theme/
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/client/
   /wp-content/plugins/wpbook/php4client/

   NOTE: If you've used previous versions, you no longer need to copy
   the wp-facebook folder (which no longer exists) to your themes directory. 
   
   If you've used versions prior to 0.9.5, you can DELETE the following 
   directory and all it's contents: 
		/wp-content/themes/wp-facebook/ 

2. Set up a New Application at http://www.facebook.com/developers/, obtaining
   a secret and API key.  

   Set the callback url to your blog url, including  a trailing slash. 
       (http://www.yourblogurl.com/)
   For canvas url, you just need something *all lower case*, unique, with
   no spaces, and no trailing slash. Remember it. 
   
   Set the application type to "website"
      
   Set the application to use an iFrame, not fbml, and to "resizable"
   (Using iFrames lets you use javascript, objects, and other tags 
    not allowed in FBML inside blog posts)

3. Login to Wordpress Admin and activate the plugin

4. Using the WPBook menu, (Dashboard->Settings->WPBook) fill 
   in the appropriate information including Facebook application secret 
   and API keys, as well as your application canvas url. 

   Enabling the "Show Invite Friends Link" will show a link inside 
   Facebook when viewing your application which allows users to send
   invites to their friends. 

   Comments inside Facebook can be enabled or disabled without any impact
   on comments when your blog is viewed outside Facebook. If you have comments
   enabled, you can optionally require users to provide their email address. 
   (Facebook does not allow access to the user's email address, so you can 
   really only ask users to provide one, not prefill it automatically). 

   Similarly, you can enable or disable gravatars within Facebook
   independent of what you do on your regular blog. 

   The "Give WPBook credit" option adds a line at the bottom of your Facebook
   application pages which says "This Facebook application powered by the 
   WPBook plugin for Wordpress" - I'd love it if you would leave this enabled
   but it is not required.  

   The "Share this post" links can also be enabled or disabled. If they are
   enabled, they will allow the user to "share" your blog posts using the 
   built in Facebook Share mechanism, including sending a message to friends
   or posting in their profile. 

   The "Enable 'view post at external site' link" enables a link to each blog post 
   at your full blog url (outside Facebook). This is useful to get folks going
   to your blog outside Facebook, to see it full size/theme etc. 

   The "Link position for share button and external link button" option determines
   where, within each post, those two links will appear - either at the top of the 
   post (before the post content) or at the bottom of the post (after the post
   content). 

   "Enable Facebook users to add your app to their profile" will show an "Add to 
   Profile" button for users viewing the app inside Facebook - this lets them choose
   to add the application to their profile. 

5. To add the application to "Pages" not just "Profiles" - see the instructions linked to from the "settings" page for the plugin. 
     
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit the way my Facebook Application (mirrored blog) looks? =

In the wpbook/theme directory, there is an index.php file.  Most of 
what you want is there.  

There's also a default/style.css which basically mimics Facebook's styles, 
as well as some other files for processing comments and the like.  

== Version History ==

= Version 1.4.2 =

* Bugfix for those who install WordPress in a subdirectory, for home comment submission was failing in 1.4 and 1.4.1. 
* Bugfix for wpbook_admin_javascript.js which included an outmoded jQuery selector syntax and broke the admin js in 2.9.1
* Bugfix for wpbook_admin_javascript.js which included hardcoded paths assuming wp_content path relative to wp-admin (shows images for default gravatar icons by default now rather than waiting for tooltip hover)

= Version 1.4.1 =
* Doh! Typo snuck into release package. (See http://wordpres.org/support/topic/348292)

= Version 1.4 =
* Fixed bug which made invite friends link only work on the home page
* Fixed bug in setting for custom/header footer which included a permalink
  (See http://wordpress.org/support/topic/306263)
* Added Gravatar support (thanks Brooke)
* Added list of pages (thanks Brooke)
* Removed hard coded references to wp-content and plugins directories
  (See http://willnorris.com/2009/05/wordpress-plugin-pet-peeve-hardcoding-wp-content)
* Removed hard coded reference to config.php
  (See http://willnorris.com/2009/06/wordpress-plugin-pet-peeve-2-direct-calls-to-plugin-files)

= Version 1.3.1 = 
* Fix for XAMPP Windows users - add ABSPATH to include for config.php
* Fix for users who have the application name *in* the permalink structure
* Cleanup for images in instructions that were too wide for layout
* Cleanup button title for submit on invite friends page
* Remove unnecessary second 'include_once' in comments.php

= Version 1.3 =
* Mostly improvements to the admin interface user experience - better 
  separation of options into required, customization, social, and advanced.

* Bugfix: No longer echoing blog name twice on the invite friends screen. 
* Bugfix: Caught case where profile box could get updated with links to 
  the original source (outside FB). 
* Note: This is expected to be the final PHP4 compatible version. Facebook's 
  client only supports PHP5, and I need to be able to wrap certain client
  calls in Try/Catch, which requires PHP5, to avoid nasty "uncaught exception"
  bugs. (Yes, there are unofficial PHP4 clients, but they are unsupported).
  If someone wants to create a PHP4 only version which trails the ongoing
  development, they are welcome to, taking this as the place from which to
  begin a fork.

  select 'display invite friends link' checkbox in the wp-admin 
  settings for WPBook, you can invite facebook friends!
* Display email box for commentors (optional)

== To Do ==
(Roughly in order of priority)
* Leverage Facebook API for posting notifications to stream when 
  a new blog post is published
* Leverage Facebook API to publish notifications to stream when
  user leaves a comment (comment poster's stream and users streams)
* Threaded comments. (If user has them enabled - requires WP 2.7.x)
* Require PHP5, wrap update of profile boxes and notifications in
  a try-catch block to avoid uncaught exceptions
* Prep for WordPress 3.0 and merge with WPMU
* Update instructions in readme to match new options available in 1.3
* Deal with non-standard front pages (where user has set
  a static page in WordPress options) - right now these configurations
  aren't really supported, and I'm not sure what support will mean - 
  just listing posts and pages? (That actually works now if you just
  use your wordpress home url as your canvas callback)
* Enable pages for things like cateories and tags, and enable links to 
  those pages from the header/footer of the post
