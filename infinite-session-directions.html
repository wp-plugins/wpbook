<body>
	<ol>
	<li>Setup your facebook application as described in the <a href="/wp-content/plugins/wpbook/README.txt">README.txt</a> for this plugin - you must
	establish the facebook application first, to get an "api key" and a "secret"</li>
	<li>Fill out the rest of the configuration on the <a href="/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wpbook.php">WPBook configuration screen</a> and submit</li>
	<li>Log out of Facebook - don't just close open browser windows but use the
	log out button inside Facebook</li>
	<li>Visit the following page, which will ask you to login, and should show you your infinite
	session key: <b><code>[blog url]/wp-content/themes/wp-facebook/infinitesession.php</code></b><br />
	(Where blog url is replaced with the url to your blog</li>
	<li>That url will redirect you to a facebook login - log in with your facebook credentials
	and you should see a screen which tells you your infinite session key.</li>
	<li>Enter that key in the <a href="/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wpbook.php">WPBook configuration screen</a></li>
	<li>Once you have an infinite session key, visit the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/editapps.php">
	Edit Applications page</a> in Facebook.</li>
	<li>Click on "Edit Settings" for your blog application</li>
	<li>Click on the profile tab in the resulting popup</li>
	<li>Add the profile box<li>
	</ol>
	
By default, the profile box is added to your "boxes" tab if you have more than 5 applications
installed - but you can move it back to your main profile using the little edit icon in the upper
right hand corder of the profile box, in your boxes page.
